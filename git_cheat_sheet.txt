Steps to create new repository and connect it with remote repository
first create a new repository on github
echo "# my_blog" >> README.md
git init                        (To initialize new project)
git status                      (To view status)
git add <file name>             (To add file in staging area)
git add -A                      (To add all  files to staging area)
git commit -m "first commit"    (To commit)
git remote add origin <Link>.git  
git push -u origin main

git status -s                   (Status in short)
git checkout <filename>         (To restore a file to last commit form)
git checkout -f                 (To restore all file to last commit form)
git log                         (details of all commits)
git log -2                      (to view details of last 2 commits)
git log -p -2                   (-p to view changes also)
git diff                        (To view difference in staged files and local changes)
git diff --staged               (Diff b/w staged files and last commited files)
git rm <file name>              (to delete file from staging area and hard disk)
git rm --cached                 (to remove only from staging area)

.gitignore file                 (In this file you can write the names of those files which will be ignored by git as if they do not exist)
touch .gitignore                (to create .gitignore file)
Eg: <filename>.<extension>      (Ignores all files with this name even in the sub directories)
*.<extension>                   (Ignores all files with this extension)
/<filename>.<extension>         (ignores the file in the folder containing .gitignore file)
/<foldername>                   (ignores this folder in the directory containing .gitignore file)

git branches are nothing but copies:
git branch                      (to view all branches)
git branch <branchname>         (creates a new branch)
git checkout <branchname>       (switch to that branch)
git merge <branchname>          (merges commits of <branchname> with current branch)
git checkout -b <branch name>   (creates new branch and also switches to that branch)

Remote repositories:
git remote add origin <Link>.git  (to connect local repository with remote repository)
git remote                      (to view all remote repositories)
git remote -v                   (to view URL of remote repositories)
git push origin <branch name>   (to push repository to remote repository)
git push origin main          (to push main branch to remote repository)
git push -u origin <branch name>       (u flag will help you to push directly to that repository the next time you just have to write "git push" instead of full command)
